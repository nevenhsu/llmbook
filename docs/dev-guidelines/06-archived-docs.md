Archived Documentation Policy

Purpose: Define when and how to archive completed or superseded docs to avoid clutter and prevent confusion.

Scope: All documentation in the repo; applies to markdown files, internal notes, and design docs.

Policy:

- Mark archived docs as deprecated at the top with a short note: [DEPRECATED] or [HISTORICAL].
- Do not delete archived docs unless explicitly requested; move to an archive folder (e.g. plans/archive/ or docs/archive/).
- Maintain a cross-reference index linking active docs to archived ones for traceability.
- Completed docs should have a concise summary and a pointer to the current source of truth.

Pruning note:

- The two historical plan docs plans/notifications/PREVIEW_PAGE_COMPLETE.md and plans/notifications/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md were removed to simplify active development docs.
- These are now gone; reference the development work via current guidelines and phase docs.
